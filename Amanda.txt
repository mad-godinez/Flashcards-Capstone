# How I get this project to run in my VSCode terminal
# Thinkful's included code requires an old version of npm which is why I do the following: 
# I use zsh on mac

% nvm use 16.13.0 
% npm start 

# Example Data is in root/data/db.json
# Live Data via servers is on port 8080/decks & port 8080/cards 

The #BUG or #ERROR is in "./src/Layout/cards/StudyCards.js" (it is the StudyCards component)
expected behavior: 
  the react hook & async function loads the data from the local server before executing the rest of the function. 
actual behavior: 
  function crashes when the `return` statement tries to read from the `undefined` data before it is finished rendering. 
  Note: return statements such as <p>card_array[0].front</p> break the component, 
        but console.log(card_array[0].front) statements throughout the body of the component do not break it.
